## [0.3.0] 2024-08-01

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/trussed-dev/ctap-types/compare/0.2.0...0.3.0

### Breaking Changes

- Use enums instead of string constants
  - Introduce `Version`, `Extension` and `Transport` enums and use them in `ctap2::get_info`
  - Fix serialization of the `AttestationStatementFormat` enum and use it in `ctap2::make_credential`
- Remove `Deserialize` implementation for `ctap2::get_assertion::Response`
- Remove `Serialize` implementation for `ctap2::{get_assertion, make_credential}::Request`
- Move `AttestationStatement`, `AttestationStatementFormat`, `NoneAttestationStatement`, `PackedAttestationStatement` from `ctap2::make_credential` into the `ctap2` module

### Added

- Add a `std` feature (disabled by default)
- Add `arbitrary::Arbitrary` implementations for all requests behind an `arbitrary` feature (disabled by default)
- Add support for CTAP 2.2 ([#38](https://github.com/trussed-dev/ctap-types/issues/38))
  - Add support for the `thirdPartyPayment` extension behind a `third-party-payment` feature (disabled by default)
  - Add new fields to `get_info`
  - Add unsigned extension outputs to `make_credential` and `get_assertion`
  - Add enterprise attestation support to `get_assertion`
  - Add support for attestation statements in `get_assertion`
  - Add support for attestation format preferences
- Derive `Copy` for `ctap2::AttestationStatementFormat`

## [0.2.0] - 2024-06-21

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/trussed-dev/ctap-types/compare/0.1.2...0.2.0

- Rename `url` to `icon` in `PublicKeyCredentialRpEntity` and ignore its
  content ([#9][])
- Truncate overlong `name` and `displayName` values for `PublicKeyCredentialEntity` instances ([#30][])
- Send empty response to clientPin instead of empty map ([#13][])
- Use references rather owned byte vectors to reduce the size of structs ([#16][])
- Accept more than 12 algorithms ([#17][])
- Add support for the `largeBlobKey` extension ([#18][])
- Remove `AuthenticatorDataFlags::EMPTY` (use `AuthenticatorDataFlags::empty()` instead)
- Allow missing algorithms in COSE keys ([#8][])
- Remove unused `REALISTIC_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE` constant
- Handle overlong `icon` values in `PublicKeyCredentialUserEntity` ([#27][])
- Update for compatibility with PIN protocol 2
- Add support for permissions in `ctap2::client_pin`
- Replace `cose` module with `cosey` dependency ([#36][])
- Mark `get_assertion::{ExtensionsInput, ExtensionsOutput}` and `make_credential::Extensions` as non-exhaustive and implement `Default`
- Mark CTAP2 request and response types as non-exhaustive where possible
- Use references where possible
- Put uncommon fields in `get_info` behind `get-info-full` feature flag and add fields for CTAP 2.1
- Use byte arrays instead of slices or Bytes<_> where possible
- Make `att_stmt` optional in `make_credential::Response`, preparing for CTAP 2.2

## [0.1.2] - 2022-03-07

[0.1.2]: https://github.com/trussed-dev/ctap-types/compare/0.1.1...0.1.2

Yanked 0.1.1 instead of 0.1.0 by mistake, re-releasing.

## [0.1.1] - 2022-03-07

[0.1.1]: https://github.com/trussed-dev/ctap-types/compare/0.1.0...0.1.1

- add CTAP2.1 Selection command
- add CTAP2.1 options

We will release this and yank 0.1.0, to avoid a minor version bump.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-03-05

[0.1.0]: https://github.com/trussed-dev/ctap-types/releases/tag/0.1.0

- use 2021 edition
- make CTAP1 and CTAP2 more homogeneous
- add Authenticator traits
- lower `MAX_CREDENTIAL_ID_LENGTH` to 255 bytes, which seems to be the
  limit used in practice (coming from U2F's size bytes)
- replace `MESSAGE_SIZE` with a theoretical and a realistic constant
- use iso7816 0.1.0 release
